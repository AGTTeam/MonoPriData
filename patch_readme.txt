Thank you for downloading this English patch of Soul Eater: Monotone Princess for Nintendo Wii!

The patch comes in two versions; a 'lite' version available on ROMhacking.net, and the 'original' version which can be downloaded on the team's GDrive. The GDrive version contains translated videos which were too large to host on ROMhacking.net. There are no other differences between the two, and both can be patched in the same way.

                   *****************************************

Before you can play the translation, you will need to do some prep-work using a PC. There are two methods which can be used to patch the game, depending on your preferences.

                           ========================
                              RIIVOLUTION METHOD   
                           ========================

Riivolution is a Homebrew App for Wii which allows you to load files off of an external memory device without modifying the game disc.

You will need:
-A Wii with the Homebrew Channel installed (see https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_setup for instructions)
-The original retail disc of Monotone Princess
-An SD card

Method:
1) Insert your SD card into your computer
2) Download and install Riivolution on your Wii https://rvlution.net/wiki/Riivolution/ (see link for install instructions)
3) Unzip 'MonopriPatch' and copy both folders inside the 'patch' subfolder onto the root of your SD card. NB: If done correctly, you should have two separate 'riivolution' folders on your SD card. One in the 'apps' subfolder, with the files downloaded from rvlution.net, and one on the root of your SD card, with "monopri.xml" copied from the patch
4) Eject your SD card and insert it, and the Monotone Princess disc, into your Wii
5) Run Riivolution on your Wii, make sure the translation patch is 'enabled', and launch the game

                           ========================
                                  ISO METHOD       
                           ========================

This method will allow you to directly patch the .iso file, which can then be played with an Emulator like Dolphin ( https://dolphin-emu.org/download/ ) or on the Wii (see https://wii.guide/ for more).

You will need:
-The latest version of WIT ( https://wit.wiimm.de/download.html )
-A copy of the game in .iso format. If you have a .wbfs file, you can either redump the game or convert it with http://www.wiibackupmanager.co.uk/

Method:
1) Download and install WIT
2) Unzip 'MonopriPatch'
3) Drag and drop your .iso file onto the 'patcher.bat' and wait for the process to complete. (It may take some time.)
4) You should now have a file called 'monopri_patched.iso' in the same location as the original .iso

Note: If you have previously played the original game in Dolphin, the game's title and banner image may still appear in Japanese. You can update this by right-clicking on the game in the file list, selecting 'Open Wii Save Folder', and deleting the 'banner.bin'. Then, in Dolphin, go to View>Purge Game List Cache. The banner image will now appear as a grey 'X', and will update after you open and save the game.


                   *****************************************
                   *           II. Known Issues            *
                   *****************************************

While the patch has been extensively tested and has no known gameplay bugs, there are some minor issues retained from the original version of the game.

TILE EDGES
Sometimes image tiles seem to be rendered 1px off, leaving small gaps in the character sprites. This occurs even with 1x Internal Resolution and Anisotropic Filtering / Anti-aliasing off. This is due to various texture interpolation issues on Dolphin and does not happen on original hardware.

FONT ISSUES
The black stroke surrounding the text is sometimes cut off. This happens with the original game and on real hardware, but is more noticeable in the patch due to the sharpness of English letters. It should not affect the legibility of the text.

CREDITS MOVIE FRAME STUTTER
When emulating the game, the credits movie stutters towards the end as Lord Death appears. This does not happen on real hardware.#TODO check if this happens with other people, test with the English video

                   * III. Changes made to the Original Game *
                   ******************************************

-Subtitles were retimed and centered. (Originally left-aligned)
-Added subtitles to the closing credits
-Generic Mini-Boss dialogue was rewritten to reference their designs.
      Jack the Ripper: historical figure of the same name
      Sonson-J: Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th
      Rasputin: historical figure of the same name
      THE CAN: Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
      Oogeyman: The Boogie Man, references from Oogie Boogie from the 
                Nightmare Before Christmas
      Johnny Rubber: Rubber Johnny; dialogue references Big Brain from
               the remake of The Hills Have Eyes, who was himself
               inspired by Rubber Johnny
      D-FlayFlay: Freddy Krueger from The Nightmare on Elm Street
      Ajhari: An acharya which is a Bhuddist monk or high priest
